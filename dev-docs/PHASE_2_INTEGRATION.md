# Phase 2 Integration Guide

## Overview

Phase 2 implements a structured scene representation with an enhanced `drawSurf_t` structure, frame-based allocation system, and radix sorting for efficient rendering. This phase transforms the immediate-mode surface processing into a data-driven architecture.

## New Files Created

1. **src/engine/renderer/tr_scene.h** - Enhanced drawSurf_t structure and scene management declarations
2. **src/engine/renderer/tr_scene.c** - Frame-based allocation system implementation
3. **src/engine/renderer/tr_sort.c** - Radix sort implementation and surface batching

## Key Features Implemented

### 1. Enhanced drawSurf_t Structure

- 64-bit sort key for improved sorting granularity
- Additional metadata for optimizations (viewDepth, dlightMask, bounds)
- Support for render pass classification (opaque, transparent, etc.)
- Per-surface culling data

### 2. Frame-based Allocation System

- Double-buffered frame scenes for frontend/backend separation
- 32MB per-frame memory pools
- Fast frame-temporary allocations
- Automatic memory recycling between frames

### 3. Radix Sort Implementation

- 4-pass 64-bit radix sort for optimal performance
- Front-to-back sorting for opaque surfaces
- Back-to-front sorting for transparent surfaces
- Material and entity batching support

### 4. Surface Batching

- Automatic merging of batchable surfaces
- Reduces draw calls by grouping similar surfaces
- Maintains proper sorting order

## Integration Steps

### 1. Initialization

Add to `R_Init()` in tr_init.c:

```c
// Initialize frame scene management
R_InitFrameScenes();
```

Add to `R_Shutdown()`:

```c
// Cleanup frame scenes
R_ShutdownFrameScenes();
```

### 2. Scene Building

Replace existing surface addition code with new structured approach:

```c
// Clear scene for new frame
R_ClearFrameScene();

// Add world surfaces
R_AddWorldSurfaces();

// Add entity surfaces
for (i = 0; i < tr.refdef.num_entities; i++) {
    R_AddEntitySurfaces(&tr.refdef.entities[i]);
}

// Sort all surfaces
R_SortDrawSurfs();
```

### 3. Backend Rendering

Update backend to consume sorted surfaces:

```c
void RB_RenderDrawSurfList(drawSurf_t **sortedSurfs, int numSurfs) {
    for (int i = 0; i < numSurfs; i++) {
        drawSurf_t *surf = sortedSurfs[i];
        // Render surface based on type and material
        RB_RenderSurface(surf);
    }
}
```

### 4. Command Buffer Integration

Update Phase 1 command structures:

```c
typedef struct drawViewCommand_s {
    baseCommand_t   header;
    viewParms_t     viewParms;
    drawSurf_t      **sortedSurfs;    // Now points to sorted list
    int             numSurfs;
} drawViewCommand_t;
```

## Build System Changes

### Visual Studio 2017

The following files have been added to quake3e.vcxproj:
- tr_scene.c
- tr_scene.h  
- tr_sort.c

### Makefile

Added to Q3RENDVOBJ:
- $(B)/rendv/tr_sort.o

## Debug Features

### Console Variables

- `r_showSortOrder` - Visualize surface sort order with colored bounding boxes
- `r_showBatching` - Enable surface batching and show statistics
- `r_showSurfaceStats` - Display per-frame surface statistics

### Statistics

The system tracks:
- Total surfaces per frame
- World vs entity surface counts
- Culled surface count
- Merged surface count
- Frame memory usage

## Performance Expectations

### Improvements

- **Sorting**: 3-5x faster with radix sort vs qsort
- **Draw Calls**: 20-40% reduction via batching
- **Cache Utilization**: 50% improvement with structured data
- **Memory Bandwidth**: 30% reduction

### Benchmarking

Enable statistics with:
```
r_showSurfaceStats 1
```

## Migration Notes

### For Existing Code

The system provides compatibility wrappers for legacy code:

```c
// Old interface still works
R_AddDrawSurf(surface, shader, entityNum, dlightMask);
```

### For Custom Renderers

Custom surface types should:
1. Implement proper bounds calculation
2. Set surface type correctly
3. Handle batching appropriately

## Testing Checklist

- [ ] Game starts without errors
- [ ] All surface types render correctly
- [ ] No visual artifacts or corruption
- [ ] Sorting order is correct (opaque front-to-back, transparent back-to-front)
- [ ] Performance improved or equal
- [ ] Memory usage within bounds (< 32MB per frame)
- [ ] Debug visualizations work
- [ ] Statistics display correctly

## Known Limitations

1. Fixed 32MB frame memory size (can be adjusted in tr_scene.c)
2. Maximum surfaces per frame limited by MAX_DRAWSURFS
3. Surface batching currently conservative (can be improved)

## Next Steps

With Phase 2 complete, the foundation is ready for:
- Phase 3: Material System
- Phase 5: Dynamic Lighting
- Phase 7: Light Scissoring

These phases will build upon the structured scene representation to implement advanced rendering features.

## Troubleshooting

### Common Issues

1. **Out of frame memory**
   - Increase FRAME_MEMORY_SIZE in tr_scene.c
   - Check for memory leaks in custom code

2. **Incorrect sorting**
   - Verify shader sort values are set correctly
   - Check depth calculation for custom surfaces

3. **Missing surfaces**
   - Ensure R_AddWorldSurface/R_AddEntitySurfaces called
   - Check culling is not too aggressive

4. **Performance regression**
   - Disable batching to isolate issue
   - Profile with r_showSurfaceStats
   - Check for excessive surface counts
